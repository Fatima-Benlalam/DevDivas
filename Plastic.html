                description: "Unfortunately, you're right!! Only about 10% of plastic waste is effectively recycled, with much of the rest ending up in landfills or the environment. Plastic debris in oceans and rivers especially pose a threat to marine life.",
                tip: "Use reusable bags, bottles, and containers to reduce the amount of waste and support recycling programs to improve recycling rates."

                description: "Yes, can you believe it ?! Microplastics often come from the shedding of synthetic fibers during washing of clothes made from polyester, nylon, and other plastics.",
                tip: "Choose natural fiber clothing (cotton, wool,linen..) to minimize microplastic pollution, and encourage others to do the same!"
